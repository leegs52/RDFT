# RDFT
Learning robust and discriminative feature transformations for unsupervised domain adaptation
RDFT achieves domain adaptation covering three aspects: 1) learning a weighted discriminative regression model 2) preserving the target structural information in the subspace 3) extracting weighted domain-invariant features. 

## Usage
* Algorithms used in experiments can be implemented by running 
```
$ matlab RDFT_demo.m
```
* ADMM iterations for unsupervised domain adaptation are performed by RDFT.m
