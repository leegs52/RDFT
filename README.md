# RDFT
Learning robust and discriminative feature transformations for unsupervised domain adaptation

RDFT achieves domain adaptation covering three aspects:

1) learning a weighted discriminative regression model
2) preserving the target structural information in the subspace
3) extracting weighted domain-invariant features. 

## Usage
* The RDFT code consists of the following parts: RDFT.m, matrixMN.m, and RDFT_demo.m

* Algorithms used in experiments can be implemented by running 
```
$ matlab RDFT_demo.m
```
